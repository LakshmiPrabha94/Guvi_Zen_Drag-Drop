A step-by-step sequence of actions for a drag and drop operation using Python, Selenium, and Action Chains on the given URL "https://jqueryui.com/droppable/":

1. Open the Browser:
      Launch a web browser (e.g., Chrome) using Selenium WebDriver.
2. Navigate to the URL:
      Open the URL "https://jqueryui.com/droppable/" in the browser.
3. Switch to the Frame:
      The drag and drop elements are inside an iframe. Switch to the frame containing the elements to interact with them.
      Locate the iframe using its class name (e.g., "demo-frame").
4. Find the Draggable and Droppable Elements:
      Find the draggable element (white rectangle box) and the droppable element (yellow rectangle box) within the iframe.
      Use the element IDs or other suitable locators to identify these elements.
5. Initialize Action Chains:
      Create an instance of ActionChains to perform complex user interactions.
6. Perform Drag and Drop:
      Use the drag_and_drop() method of ActionChains to perform the drag and drop operation.
      Pass the draggable element as the source and the droppable element as the target.
7. Execute Actions:
      Use the perform() method to execute the series of actions.
8. Wait for a Moment:
      Optionally, add a short wait (e.g., using time.sleep()) to observe the result.
9. Close the Browser:
      Close the browser to end the Selenium automation script.
